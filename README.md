# An Integrated Smart Parking Paradigm for Promulgated Sector 
A major problem in day to day life is parking of vehicles especially the car parking at an appropriate place. And this issue indirectly leads to traffic congestion. This project presents the basic concept of using server or cloud based smart parking services in smart cities as an important application of the Internet of Things paradigm. This system will be accessible through a mobile app or through the webpage provided and can be used to monitor or find the empty slots in that area. The project works in three modules. The first module is the IR sensor and the Ultra sonic sensor that senses the presence of vehicles every two sec and sends information to the Arduino. The Arduino sends data to the cloud using the GSM module. The WiFi Module has been used for the hosting service and it sends data to the mobile application. The mobile application displays the output according to the signal received from the cloud. Hence it displays the parking slot as empty or occupied. Hence this application can save a lot of time of the user as the user can find the available parking areas in a particular region and accordingly plan their visit.
